That was fun!

Generate some ASCII text (http://www.network-science.de/ascii/ might be a good start) and save them all in a folder with the following name pattern:
  slide1.txt
  slide2.txt
  slide3.txt
  slide4.txt
  slide5.txt

  and so on...

Just run the script:
  $ ruby rap.rb path_to_the_slides

Switch between the slides with 'n' and 'p'... 'q' quits ;)

That's it
